            <h2>Colombo meetup</h2><br>
            <p>
            Our first meetup in April 2024 at Viharamahadevi Park was a unique experience, as we hadn't even
             started our university lectures yet. We were all freshers, excited and curious to meet the people
              who would become our batchmates. The day was full of introductions and icebreaker games that helped us 
              get comfortable with each other. Laughter and friendly competition brought us closer as we played games 
              that let us show off our skills and sense of humor. 
            This initial gathering set a positive tone for our friendships, giving us a sense of belonging before we even began our studies.

            <h2>Kandy meetup</h2><br>
            <p>
            In August, after a few months of online classes, we met again at Peradeniya Garden in Kandy.
             By then, we knew each other a bit better, and the reunion felt like meeting old friends.
              We continued the tradition of playing games, enjoying activities that encouraged teamwork 
              and gave us a break from our studies. With the stunning garden as our backdrop, we spent the 
              day sharing stories, playing games, and taking in the peaceful surroundings. This meetup strengthened 
              our bonds even further, making us feel like a 
            tight-knit group ready to support each other through our university journey.

            This Thank you card from our Kandy meetup is a beautiful reminder of the strong bonds we share as Information Systems 
            students from Sabaragamuwa University. Traveling from far distances to meet our batchmates shows the value we place 
            on building connections beyond the virtual classroom. The card captures the essence of our gathering, filled with laughter,
             games, and heartfelt moments in the serene beauty of Peradeniya Garden. It symbolizes not just a day of
             fun but a commitment to cherishing the friendships we are building on this incredible journey together.
